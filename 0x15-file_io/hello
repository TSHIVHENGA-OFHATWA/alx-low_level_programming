Hello World!

I am getting better in this coding thing
but surely not going the way I should be and I understand that there is a lot of knowledge that I 
need to understand I need to practice more
but i also need to read more pdf and watch more vids, It kinda gets more confusing on
what to do first cause practice is essential but time to learn is also moving

 As long as I keep on trying everyday, I shall have my breakthrough
some concept are easy to grasp while others need days
